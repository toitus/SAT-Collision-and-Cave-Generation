This is a project that includes the following:
  * Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) Collision Detection and Collision Response by calculating the Minimum Translation Vector
  * Static and Dynamic Bodies in the World, allowing multiple dynamic bodies to be pushed by the player
  * Basic Game Loop and framerate limiting
  * Cellular Automata Cave Generation using Tilemapping
  * Flood filling tilemaps to identify the number of unique disconnected caves
  * Basic player movement with attached camera
